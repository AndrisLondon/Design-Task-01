            <span style="background-color:yellow">10 things</span> you should know</h1>
          <p>Climate change is disrupting weather patterns, leading to extreme weather events, unpredictable water availability, exacerbating water scarcity and contaminating water supplies. Such impacts can drastically affect the quantity and quality of water that children need to survive. Today, a change in climate is felt primarily through a change in water. Millions of children are at risk.</p>
